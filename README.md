# A Guideline to Choosing Your College Major

## üìò Description

This project presents an interactive, scroll-based web dashboard designed to guide students through the process of exploring potential college majors. Built by Team 13 for ECS 163, our interface uses data from the American Community Survey (2010‚Äì2012) and walks users through a curated sequence of visualizations, adhering to the Martini Glass design paradigm.

The user experience begins with a **bar chart** that highlights broad income trends across majors and gender. 

It then transitions into a **Sankey diagram** showing the flow of career outcomes between the agriculture and natural resource major category. 

It concludes with a fully interactive **treemap heatmap**, where users can explore detailed attributes such as earning quartiles and employment rates. Tooltips, dropdowns, and contextual blurbs support exploratory analysis and improve usability.

This visualization aims to help students, particularly those choosing or switching college majors, understand the real-world implications of their academic paths using accessible and engaging visual storytelling.
