                <p class="narrative-text">
                    Choosing a college major is one of the most important career and academic decisions students face. We know how difficult of a decision this can be, we're here to help. Our interactive site is designed to guide you through key insights from real data on college majors, median salary earnings, and employment outcomes. Through engaging visualizations and tools, you'll explore how income, fields of study, and even gender interact with one another. This resources helps you better understand the financial and demographic implications of different major choices. Whether you are deciding on a major or are wondering if your major is the right choice for you, this tool gives you the power to make informed, personalized decisions about YOUR future.

                <p class="narrative-text">
                    Our visualizations are powered by a dataset from the American Community Survey (ACS). It includes detailed information of 100+ majors, covering a surprising wide range of fields such as STEM, arts, business, etc. For each individual major, the dataset provides statistical insights on median earnings, unemployment rates, gender distributions, total number of graduates, and much more. These variables have allowed us to explore how income and employment outcomes vary through different fields of study. It has also allowed us to make key insights into hidden disparities such as gender representation and wage gaps.

                    Let's begin exploring the dataset. To start, we present two bar graphs that highlight the top 10 most commonly picked college majors by total count of students/graduates from the major. These visuals offer a quick view of what fields are most popular among each gender, helping to reveal patterns in gender representation across different areas of study. This sets the stage for a deeper analysis into how these trends might relate to income, employment, and inequalities.

                    This Sankey Diagram visualizes the pathways from college majors within the <i>Agriculture & Natural Resources </i> field of study to various employment outcomes. Each flow represents how graduates from these majors move into unemployment, employment, or further into other college-related/non-college-related jobs. Using the dropdown menu below, you can highlight a specific major and see how its outcomes differ from others. This visualization helps reveal both the diversity of post-grad pathways and the relative size scaling of each outcome, offering deeper insights into the real-world implications of choosing a major from this field of study.

                <p class="narrative-text">
                    Here, we are ready to take a deep dive into the data through this interactive heat map! Our interactive heatmap takes the form of a hierarchical treemap that visualizes college majors across different major categories using a combination of multiple colors and sizes to distinguish key insights. Each square/rectangle corresponds to the number of graduates, while the color intensity reflects the median earnings, with lighter shades indicating a lower salary and a darker shade incating higher salaries. As a user, you are able to click on individual majors to reveal detailed tooltips containing employment statistics, income percentiles, and there is even a pie chart illustrating the employment ratio breakdown.

                <h2>Conclusion & Reflection</h2>
                <p class="narrative-text"> Our visualizations aim to bridge the connection between big data and decision-making by offering college major outcomes in a clear, interactive, and personalized format. From the initial bar charts, to the overarching Sankey Diagram, to our interactive and detailed heatmap, each component of this project contributes different views of understanding for how gender, field of study, and salary intersect. We combine our summarized visuals with interactive details to provide users with the tools they need to explore these trends and disparities within different education outcomes. </p>

 <p class="narrative-text"> This project gave us the opportunity to deepen our skills in data wrangling, D3.js, and user-centered designs. We encountered many challenges with sizing, layout formats, and color scaling, which taught us a lesson about how important thoughtful design choices are. Our biggest takeaway was understanding how impactful visual choices like spacing and color were, and how these data visualization factors can make complex data more engaging and interesting to interpret. </p>

 <p class="narrative-text"> Overall, our project wasn't all about building this website, but learning how we should communicate data effectively. We hope these visualizations allow more users to explore deeper into their field of study in better understanding the environment of college majors and their long-term effects. </p>
